# Health Check After Recent Changes

This report evaluates the current state after your latest edits (including `vite.config.ts` and `client/index.html`).

## Summary
- Build/dev flow remains valid.
- No blocking errors detected.
- A few hygiene/operational risks to consider (detailed below).

## Findings

### 1) Vite allowedHosts restored to external domains
- Current: `vite.config.ts` includes `.manus*` domains along with `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`.
- Impact: Not a functional bug, but broadens who can access your dev server if exposed.
- Recommendation: If you do not need these external domains, limit to `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` for least privilege.

### 2) Analytics script placeholders present in `client/index.html`
- Current: Script references `%VITE_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT%` and `%VITE_ANALYTICS_WEBSITE_ID%`.
- Risk: If these envs are not set during build, the tag will 404 at runtime.
- Recommendation: Configure proper env vars via Vite (`.env`) or remove/guard until ready.

### 3) Mixed lockfiles (pnpm vs npm)
- Current: Repo uses pnpm (`pnpm-lock.yaml`), but `package-lock.json` exists (untracked).
- Risk: Team confusion and inconsistent dependency resolution.
- Recommendation: Delete `package-lock.json` and add it to `.gitignore` to standardize on pnpm.

### 4) Cross-platform start script
- Current: `start` uses `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` (POSIX-style).
- Risk: On Windows shells it may not set the env variable.
- Recommendation: Use `cross-env` for portability, or keep as-is if your team is macOS/Linux only.

### 5) Server static path in development
- Current: The Express server serves from `../dist/public` when not in production.
- Note: In typical dev you run only Vite (`pnpm dev`), not the server. If you do run the server before `pnpm build`, that folder wonâ€™t exist.
- Recommendation: Document expected flows (Dev: `pnpm dev`; Prod: `pnpm build && pnpm start`).

## Verdict
- OK to proceed. Consider the recommendations to minimize operational issues.

## Suggested next steps (optional)
- Tighten `allowedHosts` if external access is not required.
- Ensure analytics env vars are set before enabling the script.
- Remove and ignore `package-lock.json` to avoid mixed lockfiles.
- Add `cross-env` for `start` if you need Windows compatibility.
